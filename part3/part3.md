1. The bug was that our num1 and num2 variables were stored as strings so when we passed them to the calculateSum function, we merely conncatenated one number with the other instead of adding them.
2. I fixed this by converting the data type of the num1 and num2 in the calculateSum function using the Number() function before adding them together.
